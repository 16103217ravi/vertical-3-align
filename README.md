## Game Instructions:
* A block with a random special character ( '&', '$', ')', '(', ...) would appear on the right, and you would be prompted to place it in choice of one of the given stacks.
* When a player aligns 3 similar blocks vertically, then those 3 blocks gets destroyed, and player is awarded 15 points.
* Player will lose when any one of the stack overflows.
* The goal is to score maximum points :)

## Data Structures Used:
* Stack

## Scope for Future Work:
* Difficulty level can be added.
* Time bounded user input for the choice of stack.
* Scope for enhanced UI/UX.
